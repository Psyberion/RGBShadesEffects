These are the effects that I have created for the
[RGB Shades](http://macetech.com/store/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=14&products_id=59) created by [Macetech](http://www.macetech.com/). In order to run the code,
first follow the [programming instructions](http://docs.macetech.com/doku.php/rgb_shades)
on Macetech's webpage. The functions provided in *effects.h* should be copied
to *effects.h* in the RGB Shades code, available at their
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/macetech/RGBShades). Once this is done,
just add the function names in the *functionList* called *effectList* in the
*RGBShades.ino* file. Now, just load the code to your RGBShades and enjoy!
